 <h2>What is sex ed?</h2>
 <p>what is sex education? 
Sex education consists of excellent instruction and learning on a wide range of subjects connected to sex and sexuality. It examines values and beliefs around those subjects and aids in the development of skills necessary for navigating relationships with oneself, others, and the community as well as managing one's sexual health. Sex education can happen in classrooms, at home, in public places, or online.
</p>
<h2> Why is sex ed important?</h2>
<p>As they advance from childhood to adulthood, too many young people receive muddled and inconsistent information about relationships and sex, This has caused young people to be confused. When sexuality education is thorough, the advantages extend far beyond knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases and other health problems. To prevent and counteract child sex abuse, sexual assault, and sexual exploitation, sex education is crucial. 

</p>
<p> Perhaps friends, peer groups, books, and social/mass media were the main sources of such knowledge and dialogue for the majority of people. Few people can say that their parents, siblings, or school taught them the principles of good sexual behavior. Instead, many people believe that during their youth and adolescence, talking about sexual things in their family networks made them uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>Sex (sexuality) education involves more than just teaching or learning about sex and sexuality; it also involves understanding sexual and reproductive rights, making responsible sexual choices, and achieving the highest possible standards of sexual health. It works well as a tool for health promotion. The "what, when, and how" of intimacy and relationships, sexual identity, gender roles, body image, sexual decision-making, sexually transmitted infections (STI), reproductive health, and contraception are all included in the majority of official and informal curricula around the world. The Campos guidebook states that sex education is.
